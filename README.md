# SLAM
Landmark Detection &amp; Tracking (SLAM)
In this project, I localized a robot in a 2D grid world. The basis for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is to gather information from a robot's sensors and motions over time, and then use information about measurements and motion to re-construct a map of the world.
